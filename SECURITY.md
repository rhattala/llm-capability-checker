# Security Policy

## 🔒 Our Commitment to Security

We take the security of LLM Capability Checker seriously. Even though this is a local-only application with no network communication (except model database downloads), we want to ensure it's safe for everyone to use.

## 🛡️ What We Do to Stay Secure

### Privacy-First Design
- **No telemetry or tracking** - We don't collect any user data
- **Local-only operation** - All processing happens on your machine
- **No account required** - No authentication or user databases
- **No external APIs** - Except for downloading the model database from GitHub
- **Open source** - Full transparency, audit the code yourself

### Secure Development Practices
- Regular dependency updates
- Code reviews for all contributions
- Automated security scanning (planned)
- Following .NET security best practices
- Minimal external dependencies

### Data Storage
- All user data stored locally on your machine
- No cloud storage or external servers
- User settings stored in standard app data directories
- No sensitive information collected or stored

## 🐛 Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ Not released    |

We will support the latest major version and provide security updates as needed.

## 🏆 Security Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who help us keep LLM Capability Checker secure:

<!-- Security researchers will be listed here after responsible disclosure -->

*No security vulnerabilities have been reported yet.*

## 🔐 Scope

### In Scope

The following are within the scope of our security policy:

- ✅ The main application (LLMCapabilityChecker)
- ✅ Build and deployment scripts
- ✅ Dependencies and third-party libraries
- ✅ Data handling and storage
- ✅ File system access and permissions
- ✅ Model database downloads

### Out of Scope

The following are NOT considered security vulnerabilities:

- ❌ Issues requiring physical access to the user's machine
- ❌ Social engineering attacks
- ❌ Denial of service (DOS) by local resource exhaustion
- ❌ Security issues in third-party applications or operating systems
- ❌ Issues already publicly disclosed
- ❌ Issues requiring highly unlikely user interaction
- ❌ Vulnerabilities in outdated/unsupported versions

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **User data is local**: All settings and data stored on user's machine
- **No cloud sync**: We don't sync data to any servers
- **File permissions**: App respects OS file permissions

### Network Security

- **No credentials**: No API keys or passwords transmitted
- **Certificate validation**: Standard .NET certificate validation

### System Access
- **Read-only hardware detection**: We only read system information
- **User-level permissions**: No admin/root access required
- **Standard directories**: Uses OS-standard app data directories

## 🛠️ Security Features

### Current
- HTTPS-only downloads
- No external API calls (except model database)
- Local-only data storage
- No user authentication or accounts
- Open source for transparency

### Planned
- Automated dependency scanning
- Code signing for releases
