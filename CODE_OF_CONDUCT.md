## üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## üåê Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

This includes:
- GitHub repository (issues, PRs, discussions, code)
- Community chat platforms (if/when established)
- Social media interactions about the project
- Events and meetups related to the project
- Any other community forums or platforms

## ‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via:

- **GitHub Issues**: For public concerns, open an issue with the `conduct` label
- **Email**: [Contact maintainer email - to be added]
- **Direct Message**: Contact project maintainers directly on GitHub

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## üìã Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## ü§ù Our Values

In addition to the standards above, we want to highlight some values that make our community great:

### **Inclusivity**
Everyone is welcome here, regardless of their skill level or background. We were all beginners once!

### **Respect**
Treat others as you'd like to be treated. Disagree respectfully and constructively.

### **Collaboration**
We're all working toward the same goal: helping people run LLMs locally. Let's help each other succeed.

### **Transparency**
Be open about your intentions and actions. If you make a mistake, own it and learn from it.

### **Patience**
Not everyone has the same knowledge or experience. Take time to explain and help others learn.

### **Gratitude**
Recognize and appreciate the contributions of others. A simple "thank you" goes a long way!

## üéØ Positive Community Examples

Here are some ways to be a great community member:

* **Welcoming newcomers**: "Welcome to the project! If you need any help getting started, feel free to ask."
* **Helpful feedback**: "This is a great start! Here are a few suggestions that might improve it..."
* **Sharing knowledge**: "I ran into this issue too. Here's what worked for me..."
* **Celebrating wins**: "Great work on this PR! This will really help users with older GPUs."
* **Being patient**: "No worries! This can be confusing. Let me explain it another way..."
* **Showing appreciation**: "Thanks for taking the time to write such detailed documentation!"
