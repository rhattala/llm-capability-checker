# LLM Capability Checker - Project Overview

## Project Name
**LLM Capability Checker** (working title)

## Vision Statement
An intelligent desktop application that empowers users to understand their hardware's capabilities for running, training, and fine-tuning Large Language Models locally. Goes beyond simple benchmarking to provide actionable guidance, upgrade paths, and educational content.

## Core Problem Statement
Users investing in local LLM deployment face uncertainty about:
- Can my hardware run specific models?
- What performance can I expect?
- Should I train/fine-tune locally or use cloud services?
- What upgrades would give me the best value?
- Which models are best suited for my use case and hardware?

## Target Users

### Primary Personas
1. **The Enthusiast Beginner**
   - New to local LLMs
   - Wants to understand capabilities
   - Needs educational guidance
   - Budget-conscious about upgrades

2. **The Developer/Researcher**
   - Experienced with ML/AI
   - Needs quick technical assessment
   - Wants hard numbers and comparisons
   - Makes informed upgrade decisions

## Unique Value Proposition
- **First comprehensive tool** covering inference, training, AND fine-tuning
- **Actionable recommendations** not just numbers
- **Educational mode** that explains the "why"
- **Smart upgrade advisor** with cost-benefit analysis
- **Real-world model matching** to popular models
- **Framework-aware** (checks for CUDA, ROCm, DirectML, etc.)

## Platform & Technology Stack

### Platform
- **Primary**: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- **Framework**: Avalonia UI (cross-platform capable)
- **Architecture**: Cross-platform design (can extend to Linux/macOS)

### Technical Stack
- **Language**: C# / .NET 8+
- **UI**: Avalonia UI (XAML-based, modern, cross-platform)
- **Distribution**: Portable executable (.exe)
- **Data Source**: JSON from GitHub repository (updated at startup)
- **Privacy**: Fully local with opt-in anonymous data sharing

## MVP Feature Set

### Core Capabilities
1. **Hardware Detection & Scoring**
   - Automatic system detection (CPU, GPU, RAM, VRAM, Storage)
   - Three separate scores: Inference, Training, Fine-tuning
   - Overall capability rating with clear explanations

2. **Model Recommendations**
   - Personalized model suggestions based on hardware
   - Performance estimates (tokens/sec, training time estimates)
   - Quantization level recommendations (4-bit, 8-bit, 16-bit, FP32)

3. **Upgrade Advisor**
   - Bottleneck identification
   - Cost-effective upgrade suggestions
   - Before/after comparison
   - "Best bang for buck" recommendations

4. **Framework Compatibility Checker**
   - CUDA version detection
   - ROCm support
   - DirectML availability (Windows)
   - oneAPI detection
   - WSL2 configuration status

5. **Educational Mode**
   - Explain why each spec matters
   - Visual bottleneck analysis
   - Tutorial walkthroughs
   - Glossary of terms

6. **Comparison Tools**
   - Your PC vs. recommended specs
   - Compare with community benchmarks
   - Historical tracking (how scores change over time)

7. **Optional Real Benchmarks**
   - Run actual inference tests (optional)
   - Integration with llamafile for portability
   - Quick test (~30 seconds) vs. comprehensive test (~5 minutes)

8. **Model Database**
   - Latest popular models (updated from GitHub JSON)
   - Requirements per model
   - Quantization variants
   - Framework compatibility info

### User Modes
- **Beginner Mode**: Simplified interface, more explanations, guided experience
- **Advanced Mode**: Technical details, raw metrics, expert options

## Out of Scope for MVP
- Cloud provider comparisons
- Distributed training scenarios
- Multi-GPU configuration (focus on single GPU first)
- Mobile platforms
- Actual model download/installation
- Running the models themselves (just assessment)

## Success Metrics
- User can assess their system in < 2 minutes
- 90%+ accuracy in hardware detection
- Clear actionable recommendations for 100% of configurations
- Educational content understandable by beginners
- Upgrade suggestions with specific product recommendations

## Development Principles
1. **Minimal Code**: Achieve maximum functionality with least code
2. **Optimization First**: Fast startup, low memory footprint
3. **No Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies, ship as standalone
4. **Privacy First**: No data collection without explicit opt-in
5. **Offline Capable**: Core functionality works without internet (except initial model DB download)
6. **AI-Friendly Code**: Clear structure, comprehensive comments, easy for AI to understand and maintain

## Project Timeline (Estimated)
- **Phase 1**: Core hardware detection + scoring (Week 1-2)
- **Phase 2**: Model database + recommendations (Week 2-3)
- **Phase 3**: UI implementation (Beginner + Advanced modes) (Week 3-4)
- **Phase 4**: Upgrade advisor + educational content (Week 4-5)
- **Phase 5**: Optional benchmarking integration (Week 5-6)
- **Phase 6**: Polish, testing, optimization (Week 6-7)

## Distribution Strategy
1. **Initial Release**: GitHub releases (portable .zip)
2. **Future**: Consider Windows Package Manager (winget)
3. **Updates**: Auto-check for model database updates
4. **Community**: GitHub for issues, feature requests, model DB contributions

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Hardware detection inaccuracy → **Mitigation**: Multiple detection methods, fallbacks
- **Risk**: Model DB becomes outdated → **Mitigation**: Auto-update from GitHub, community contributions
- **Risk**: Performance estimates inaccurate → **Mitigation**: Optional real benchmarking, crowd-sourced data
- **Risk**: Too complex for beginners → **Mitigation**: Beginner mode with progressive disclosure
